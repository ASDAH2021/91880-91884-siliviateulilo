    <h1>Relevant implications</h1>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Relevant implication #1: Functionality</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>This relevant implication ensures coders to double check if everything is working the way it's supposed to be working on their websites. It reminds coders to check whether there any bugs within the website, and if so they should fix it. It helps coders to see whether it works on other devices aswell as a computer. The functinality implication basically helps coders check if their website is functioning properly.</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>The functionality of my website is pretty good. There are no bugs or glitches within my website while I'm using it, and it works very well. All the links on my website (contact me, homepage, ethnicity, and hobbies) are up to date and working well. My website can also be accessed on a computer and laptop, it can also be accessed on a phone but there is a slight issue with the format of the navigation bar. By this I mean, if you access my website using a phone, somethings on the navigation bar will be stacked behind each other. Although everything about my website is functioning well, it's just when you try accessing the website on a mobile phone that has an issue.</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #2: Aesthetics</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>This relevant implication covers the visual aspects of a website. It questions whether the website is attractive to the eye, and if the website follows the design coventions.</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>I feel like my website is attractive to those who like basic colors that are not too bland but not too bright. My website does follow the design conventions because the layout of my website and its pages are all in order. By this I mean, my navigation bar is at the very top, followed by my header, then any information is in the middle, and my footer is always at the very bottom of the page. I am very happy with the outcome of my website. The color scheme I've chosen is not too bright compared to what it was before I changed and edited my pages.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Relevant implication #3: Cultural</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>The Cultural Relevant Implication reminds coders to look for three main aspects. One, currect punctuation and spelling of different languages, for example apostrophies, and macrons. Two, see whether it is culturally appropriate, by this I mean to ensure any information BORROWED from other cultures is appropriate for them to be sharing, and three, this relevent inplication also ensures coders to treat every culture fairly.</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>My website does abide by the cultural implication because, I've made sure to double check my grammar and spelling to meet the other cultures standards. I've also made sure to only use appropriate information but not too much. I've used enough information about the different cultures mentioned in my website. Lastly I've ensured to treat each culture fairly.</p>
