      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Tonga but raised in New Zealand. All my life I was bought up in West Auckland and also went to schools around that area. I currently go to Auckland Seventh-day Adventist Highschool in South Auckland, which was really out of my comfort zone at first. I've been attending ASDAH for 2 years now and I'm currently a year 11 ongoing NCEA Level 1. I hate talking to people,I am not a people person, and I'm not one to speak if not spoken to. I come from a family of 7. I have two brothers and two sisters. I'm a very lazy person, but I still try to be active. I am cureently 15 years of age, and I wish we could go back into lockdown. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. I'm a pretty introverted person. I like to keep to myself, and I don't like being around many people. I'd rather stay home and be with my family (cousins, siblings, etc..) than going out to places with my friends. I don't like socialising, and I don't like many people (I guess it runs in the family). I'm very anti-social. I usually look unapproachable mainly because I don't want to be bothered :) I have long curly hair, my resting face makes me look angry all day long, I have dark brown eyes, and a smile can change the unapproachable vibe I give out.
