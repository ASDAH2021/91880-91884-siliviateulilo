    <h4>Tonga</h4>
   <p> I come from the beautiful island of Tonga. Tonga is in Oceania, it is an archipelago, this means Tonga is made up of many islands, 170 to be exact. Tonga is in the South Pacific Ocean location directly south of Samoa. The Kingdom of Tonga is also known as the "Friendly Islands". In the Tongan culture, religion very important. Majority of the Tongan community belong to a Christian Church, others are Mormon and Wesleyan (Methodist). In Tonga, Sunday is the one day of the whole week where everything is to be closed. Tongans strongly believe in keepping the sabbath, therefore everything is usually closed on a Sunday. Tonga is the only pacific island that has its own Royal Family. There are three main islands in Tonga, Tongatapu, Ha'apai, and Vava'u. My family roots (Dad's family) are planted in Lofanga, which is an island located within the Ha'apai and from my mom's family are based in Vava'u.
     I was born in Tonga as well as my older brother. We were both raised there for about 2 years then moved to New Zealands the year I turned 2 and we've been living here ever since.</p>

    <h4>Israel</h4>
    <p>Israel is the birthplace of the Jewish culture. A lot of the history of ancient Israel is found inside the Bible. The people of Israel (the Israelites) were slaves in Egypt from 1750 B.C to 1280 B.C. I don't know much about my Jewish culture but I hope to learn more one day.</p>
