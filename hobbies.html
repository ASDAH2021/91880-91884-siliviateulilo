    <p>This page talks about my hobbies. I will talk about why I love what I do and what got me interested in it.</p>

    <p>One of the main things I love is music. Whether it's performing or listening to music. I grew up in a very musically talented family. Whether I was at home or over at my aunties and uncle's house I was canstantly around people who loved music. I guess being around people who admired music also encouraged me to find a love for it too. I enjoy music because, no matter how I'm feeling I can also find a song that matches the way I feel, or if I want to be by myself, I can just listen to music.</p>

    <p> I just recently started getting back into playing sports. One of my favourite sports to playis netball. I like being able to be on a court with my friends and play against other schools. I like playing netball because after everything with school and studies, netball is a way for me to just forget about all my assessments, even if it's only for 40mins, its a way for me to get away from the books and pens and just have fun.</p>
